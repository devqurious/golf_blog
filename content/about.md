Lofttales is driven by, or putted along, depending on how you see it, by the two of us.

### Raman Kalia

A much grounded person, much like his game. He prefers to talk more about golf than play. His only wish is to meet the inventor of this glorious game and wriggle his neck.

### Devendra Rath

He has been playing this game for many years, and in the intervening years, his game has changed by leaps and bounds. He started bad, and now he has become worse, in a wierd degenerative manner.
