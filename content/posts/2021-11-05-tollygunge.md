# Tollygunge Club

Tollygunge club, or Tolly as it's affectionately called, is all of [220 years old](https://www.tollygungeclub.org) much older than independent India. You definitely feel the "club" atmosphere all around, and even the waiters are intimidating and can ask you to get out if you're not dressed apprpriately.

Even though it is situated in the heart of the city of Kolkata, the course spread across a large area providing enough opportunities for the golfer to go into woods, water and bushes. The best aspect of this course are the greens - they run fast and true. 

A few things to note:
- IGU members get a discount, so do carry your card if you have it.
- You will need to make a card for any purchases there, cash is strict no-no.
- The pro-shop is good, and they do have decent sets for hire. 
- If it's Kolkata, it's probably a hot day out there. Caps, and drinks to hydrate!

This is my brother who introduced me to this insane game. Here he is celebrating a par.

### In and around

 Right next door is the [second oldest golf course in the world outside the British Isles](https://www.rcgc.in/golf_course/history.php). Come for the history, stay for the golf. I did not get a chance to play there unfortunately,.
 
 Here are a few things you can do once the game is done:
 
 - Walk around Maidan. Kolkata is sport loving city, and watching a game of football (soccer) can be a lot of fun. Also, the vast open space is great place for a stroll.
 - Walk down Park Street and sample some of the food there. Definitely checkout the rolls. This is also the place to do some pavement book browsing...
 - If you're in Eco Park area, there is a small 9 hole golf course called [Club De Golf](https://www.facebook.com/ClubDeGolfKolkata/). Don't understimate it though - it's got a few water bodies strategically located to drown your balls.

That's a wrap up of golf at Kolkata.
