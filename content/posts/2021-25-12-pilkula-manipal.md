Pilkula Golf Club is located on the outskirts of Mangalore, Karnataka. IGU members are allowed in, and so I decided to go and make a fool of myself.

Sattelite view of the course, and the trademark shape of most course. Most of the holes are straight, although try telling the ball that. There are a few dog-legged holes too.

The drive up to the course is quite scenic, up a winding road with forests on either side.

It is a 9-hole course, but you can play 18, if you wish by repeating the holes and playing for different positions. It's a typical hilly course, and you do need to bring your upslope, and down slope specialty shots (sadly, I did not! :)).

The course could do with more trees - while trees are mosly a hindrance to the golfer, they do have their upsides - by providing much needed shade all around. I played around Christmas, and even at 9am, it seemed like the Sun had moved to Pilkula.

I forget which hole this is, but if you look closely, there is a small white pole which gives the line to the golfer. My ball soared exactly above it, that one rare time when the driver gods decide to please you.

The bunkers were well maintained, and felt a bit like the ones you see in Links courses. Deep bunkers designed to scare the living daylights. Here I am, making a lucky escape, but only after hitting the second shot from the bunker.

Trying to get on the green.

A small club house, the little white building in the distance, is there to welcome you back. The fish is highly recommended, along with some hard boiled rice.

This is a nice course, and offers a good challenge for golfers of all skills. If you're in the vicinity, stop by for a swing and chip. And a bite of that fish.

PS: Yes, without belt. Sheesh.

## Other Things to Do

### Near the Course

The golf course is right next to a zoo, a science museum and a planetarium - perfect place to go if you have kids, or one at heart. A single combo ticket gets you into all three places, and you can be ferried around in small electric vehicles.

### In Mangalore

Try out Pabba's ice cream - there was a long line when we went, and that's always a good sign. It did not disappoint.

The Choconut was fantastic. So was the pan ice cream.

As I was walking out, observed a lot of folks eating the "Gadbad" ice cream and maybe that's we should have ordered too. 

Oh well, there's always a next time.
