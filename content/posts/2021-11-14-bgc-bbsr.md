# Bhubaneswar Golf Club

Bhubaneswar is the capital city of Orissa. On the outskirts is the [Bhubaneswar Golf Club (BGC)](https://bgc.esspl.com) - a small, yet very well maintained, and challenging nine hole course. The club house is situated at the top of a small hill, and it is from here that you tee off for the first and tenth holes.

The layout of the course is mainly up and down, and all around the base of the hill. There is one par 3 which is a blind hole - the caddie hands you the club and walks to the green and then yells out to you from there to hit the ball. The caddie and I played the course on a wet day, with the rain coming down by the buckets off and on.

It was a wet, wet day...

and nothing better than a hot cup of coffee sipped at the empty club house at the end of the game.

Nothing to write home about, except that it was challenging enough to just complete the round after battling the elements...

PS: 

The club is affiliated with IGU, so IGU members can walk right in and play - the green fees are quite reasonable. Just make sure there is no tournament on, so calling the caddie master in advance might be a good thing.
