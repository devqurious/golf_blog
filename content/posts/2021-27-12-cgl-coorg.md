A [lovely little golf course](https://coorggolflinks.in/index.php/club/), tucked away in the hills. Here you get a chance to play golf as it was meant to be. In the lap of nature as she rolls your ball this way and that way, and yet you try to keep it to the middle of the fairway. This also happens to be my home course, and I was absolutely thrilled to be playing it for the first time.

Virajpet is the nearest town for this course, and it takes about 30 mins from Virajpet to CGL. There are many homestays in the vicinity too or if you're lucky you could try for a room inside the course itself. Right next to the couse is a resory called Ambatty resort, which is another good option.

It's a complete 18-hole course, with some pretty long par 5-s. If you're used to playing in a city course, as I am, the undulating nature of the course takes time getting used to. Almost all the shots I had to hit were upslope, or downslope - tricky!

I teed off at 7am and there was hardly anybody on the course - of course, it was a week day. The first hole is intimidating enough - water to cross over. Breathe in. 

Misty mountains all around to witness your round.

The club house also looks pretty as a painting and serves up some great sizzlers.
